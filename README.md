The Quiz Game is a simple Python-based command-line application where users can test their knowledge by answering multiple-choice questions. The game asks a series of questions, gives four options for each, and checks whether the selected answer is correct or not. At the end of the game, it displays the final score.
This project is beginner-friendly and helps in understanding Python basics, including lists, dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.
